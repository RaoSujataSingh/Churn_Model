# Churn_Model
## Background: 
In telecom domain where the customer acquisition has higher cost than customer retention and where there is a rampant price war, it becomes important to predict and profile the customer behavior and predict them so that offers can be rolled out to retain them prior to switching.
## Data:
Data consists of the various behavior of customers and the last column states if the customer is still with the existing telecom company or not.
- Columns:

## Objective:
- Understand the current state and various factors which is contributing to customer churn.
- Develop a prediction algorithm to predict customer churn.
- Model Evaluation and Model Metric 
- Extra features could have made the model better and give a better explanation of the factors leading to churn
- Strategy to arrest customer churn

## Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning : Check and treat missing and outlier values.
2. Hypothesis Generating
3. EDA
4. Model Development | Feature Selection
5. Model Development | Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest
6. Model Development | With Engineered Features
7. Model Evaluation
8. Identifying important features
9. Strategies
